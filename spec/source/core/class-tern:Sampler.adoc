==== Class: tern:Sampler

[cols="1,4"]
|===
| Property | Value

| IRI | link:https://w3id.org/tern/ontologies/tern/Sampler[`tern:Sampler`]
| Status | `stable` icon:check-circle[]
| Label | Sampler
| Definition | A device that is used by, or implements, a (`Sampling`) `Procedure` to create or transform one or more samples.

| Scope note | A ball mill, diamond drill, hammer, hypodermic syringe and needle, image Sensor or a soil auger can all act as sampling devices (i.e., be Samplers). However, sometimes the distinction between the Sampler and the Sensor is not evident, as they are packaged as a unit. A Sampler need not be a physical device.

| IRI | http://www.w3.org/ns/ssn/implements[`ssn:implements`]
| Shape IRI | https://w3id.org/tern/shapes/tern/Sampler-implements
| Status | `stable` icon:check-circle[]
| Label | implements
| Definition | Relation between an entity that implements a Procedure in some executable way and the Procedure (an algorithm, procedure or method).
| Scope note | 
| Implementation | A `tern:Sampler` _MUST_ have at least 1 `ssn:implements` predicate where the value node is an IRI.
| Cardinality | Minimum 1
